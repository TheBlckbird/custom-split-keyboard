# Custom Split Keyboard

The PCBs for my custom split keyboard are available in this repository.

The PCB is made for hotswap switches compatible with the Choc v1 or v2 footprint.
The first unique part about this is that it only uses one MCU and connects the two sides with a miniHDMI cable.
The other unique thing is that it has arrow keys.

## Layout

## Roadmap for future versions

- [ ] Rethink the key layout
    - [ ] Are the arrow keys really needed?
- [ ] Wireless (partially or completely using the nice!nano)
- [ ] LEDs for the wired version
- [ ] Display for the wireless version (nice!view or e-paper)
